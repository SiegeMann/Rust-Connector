# Rust-Server-Connector-Script
A script that used to connect to rust servers at certain times, for example wipe times.


Disclaimer: this script is not bannable by facepunch, as they themselves have stated that automation that does not interfer with the game files is not a bannable offense, however specific server providers might feel differently, use at your own risk.
